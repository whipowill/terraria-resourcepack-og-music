# Terraria: Original Music Resource Pack

A resource pack for Terraria that reverts (imperfectly) game music back to how it was in versions 1.3 and prior.

Specifically, the objection is to tracks Town and Windy.  They are just the worst and they play constantly.  For old players like myself, this complete breaks the chill mood of the game.

This mod replaces Town and Windy w/ other tracks from the original game.  Due to copyright issues, I'm not actually including the MP3 files in this repo.  But you can [find](https://archive.org/search?query=terraria+ost) them.

## Install

- Download these files into ``Terraria/ResourcePacks/OGMusic/``
- Find MP3 files for the following tracks:
    - ``Overworld Day.mp3``
    - ``Overworld Night.mp3``
    - ``Rain.mp3``
- Copy and paste these MP3 files into ``Terraria/ResourcePacks/OGMusic/Content/Music/``
- Rename them as follows:
    - ``Overworld Day.mp3`` -> ``Music_46.mp3``
    - ``Overworld Night.mp3`` -> ``Music_47.mp3``
    - ``Rain.mp3`` -> ``Music_44.mp3``
- Launch the game and activate the pack
